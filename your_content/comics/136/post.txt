From the bottom of my heart THANK YOU EVERYONE for your overwhelmingly positive response tomy little comic! I have learned so much in just this first chapter. I'm going to take some time to apply what I have learned and I look forward to coming back in two weeks to start Chapter 2. Thank you thank you thank you! <3
